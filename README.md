Personal Dotfiles
=================

Dotfiles for personalized configuration and settings.  All OS X-specific
config should go in .osx.

These dotfiles are not prefixed with '.' - they assume the use of rcm for
managing all the dotfiles and also of either thoughtbot's dotfiles for initial
setup or a team or organization general settings dotfiles.
